# Big Data Processing with R: Airbnb Data Analysis
Quantitative and qualitative statistical studies, with the creation of a Shiny application to explore various parameters of an AirBnB database  

This project, conducted by Hamza Boukhalfa, aims to explore and analyze Airbnb's data to extract relevant insights regarding the tourism market. Thanks to a rigorous methodology and the use of R for big data processing, this work provides a deep understanding of current market dynamics.

## Introduction

The tourism industry has been revolutionized by the arrival of Airbnb, a platform that changes the way travelers search for and book accommodations. With a vast dataset at our disposal, analyzing and interpreting this information is essential for gaining deeper insights into market dynamics.

## Objectives

- To explore Airbnb data to identify current trends in the tourism sector.
- To use R for processing and analyzing Airbnb's big data.
- To extract meaningful insights that can help understand the behavior of hosts and guests on the platform.

## Technologies Used

- **R**: A programming language and software environment for statistical analysis and graphics.
- **HTML**: Used for producing output documents after analysis.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Installing Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have R and RStudio installed on your computer. You can download R from [the official CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/) and RStudio from [the RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

### Step 2: Opening the Project

Open RStudio, then use the 'Open Project' feature to open the cloned folder as an RStudio project.

### Step 3: Installing Dependencies

In the R console of RStudio, install the necessary R packages by executing:

```
install.packages("package_name")
```

Replace `"package_name"` with the names of the packages required for this project. You will find a list of dependencies in the `Hamza_Boukhalfa_Airbnb.Rmd` file.

### Step 4: Running the Code

Open the file `Hamza_Boukhalfa_Airbnb.Rmd` in RStudio. You can run the code section by section to observe the analyses and visualizations generated, or you can compile it entirely to generate an HTML document with all the results.
